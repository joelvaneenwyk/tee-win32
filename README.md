## Usage

```bash
tee for Windows

Copy standard input to output file(s), and also to standard output.

Usage:
  gizmo.exe [...] | tee.exe [options] <file_1> ... <file_n>

Options:
  -a --append  Append to the existing file, instead of truncating
  -b --buffer  Enable write combining, i.e. buffer small chunks
  -f --flush   Flush output file after each write operation
  -i --ignore  Ignore the interrupt signal (SIGINT), e.g. CTRL+C
  -d --delay   Add a small delay after each read operation
```

### Terminal output

Tee can be used as an intermediate buffer (i.e. *without* writing to a file) to greatly speed-up terminal output:

```bash
gizmo.exe [...] | tee.exe NUL
```

## Implementation

This is a "native" implementation of the **`tee`** command that builds directly on top of the Win32 API.

It uses [multi-threaded I/O and triple buffering](https://github.com/dEajL3kA/tee-win32/wiki/Multi%E2%80%90Threading) for maximum throughput.

## System Requirements

This application requires Windows Vista or later. All 32-Bit and 64-Bit editions, including ARM64, are supported.
